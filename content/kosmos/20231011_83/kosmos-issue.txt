With the start of the Kirby 4 beta phase, we are more and more approaching the final release of Kirby 4, so it's time for an update.


## New releases

Last week, we released [Kirby 3.9.7](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.9.7) with a new feature that allows you to mask variables that are displayed when showing errors with Whoops, as well as some enhancements and bug fixes.

And at the end of September, we released the [second beta of Kirby 4](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/4.0.0-beta.2). It comes with a long list of enhancements, improvements and a QR code generator!


## Introducing a new license scheme for Kirby 4

With the upcoming release of Kirby 4 in autumn, we will introduce a new license scheme that not only focuses on the longevity of Kirby, but also on you, our community. Here are the basics in a nutshell:

* The regular license price remains at 99 € despite the high inflation rate.

* For larger companies and organizations with a yearly revenue or funding of 1 million € and more, the license will cost 399 €.

* Both licenses come with all of Kirby's features and can be used with the included versions indefinitely (i.e. they don't expire).

* We will continue to support students, educational projects, social and environmental organizations, charities and non-profits with free licenses.

* Your license will cover all major releases within 3 years of activation. This means that regardless of when you purchase your license, the 3-year period only starts when you publish and register your website.

## Say hello to our brand-new UI lab

The UI lab is a hidden layer that will be directly accessible in the Panel at `/panel/lab`. The Lab includes interactive examples of all our components, libraries and of our design system. Every component has its own docs' drawer with documented props, slots and more. The source code of every example can be inspected, and you can even add your own test examples.

The UI lab will ship with the upcoming Beta 3 of Kirby 4. Some impressions to wet your mouth:

## Bye-bye PHP 8.0


PHP 8.3 will be released next month, and we will support PHP 8.3 in Kirby 4 right from the start. However, since a library we use only released support for PHP 8.3 in the same version that it is dropping support for
PHP 8.0, we will also drop support for PHP 8.0 with Kirby 4.0.

We are also planning to release a Kirby 3.10 version with PHP 8.3 support (while dropping PHP 8.0 support) for those of you using v3 in projects and eager to update PHP versions.
