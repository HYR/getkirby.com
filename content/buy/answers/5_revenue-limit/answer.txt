Title: What is the revenue limit?
----
Text:

With an **Enterprise license**, there is **no revenue limit** and you can simply ignore this.

The **Basic license** only applies to projects of individuals, companies and organizations with a **yearly revenue of less than € 1 million**.

Revenue means net sales. Not to be confused with profit. Should you not have any sales (e.g. as a foundation or association), your ongoing funding/yearly budget is relevant instead.

If you are building a website for a client (as a freelancer or agency), it is not about your own revenue, but about the revenue of your client.

We only care about the revenue at the time of purchase. If your company becomes more successful within the next 3 years and crosses the limit, we are really happy for you. You don't need to get a different license though. We don't ask you to look into the future – that's too hard.

Only when you purchase an upgrade at a later time, we will ask you to consider if your project then needs a different license.
