			Kirby started in <a class="link" href="<?= url('10') ?>">2012</a> as a side project by Bastian. Over the years, the team grew from within the community. Sonja, Lukas, Nico and Ahmet basically hired themselves, by just being invaluable members. Together, we moved Kirby forward significantly.
		</p>

		<p>
			The next step became obvious. <mark>Today, we replace the Bastian Allgeier GmbH with our new <nobr>Content Folder GmbH & Co. KG</nobr></mark>.
			A company that grew from the community and intends to grow further from here: <nobr>100% self-funded</nobr> by the team.
